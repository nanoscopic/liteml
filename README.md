Lite Markup Language - Tiny scripting/installer language

LiteML is designed to be a DSL ( Domain Specific Language ) for scripting installers. To create executables that are
both as small as possible but flexible while still allowing introspection, this scripting language was created with
the primary goal of calling pre-existing library functions via XML scripting.

The current code just demonstrates the basic ability to call arbitrary functions from XML configuration on both
Windows and Linux/GNU platforms. All variables types are not yet supported; this is alpha code and has not yet been
made production ready.
